	<h2>My Education</h2>
	<p>I attended Big Sandy Community and Technical College in Prestonsburg, Kentucky for two years before transferring to Alice Lloyd College. In 2016, I graduated from Alice Lloyd College with a Bachelor of Science in Biological Science Education, Grades 8-12. In 2019, I graduated from the University of Pikeville with a Master of Education in Teacher Leadership.
		<p>I am currently taking classes at <strong>Eastern Kentucky University</strong> to become a school librarian. I have loved to read since I was a little girl. I loved to go to the school library as well as the public library. When I finish the school librarian program, I hope to become an elementary school librarian. I want to inspire the young children of Eastern Kentucky to become readers.<br>
